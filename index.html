      <p id="aboutMe">Hi! I'm Isabella, I'm studying to become a web developer so this website, showcases some of the things I can do!
        I previously studied games programming, so some of my projects I will list were from my time doing that!
        I used to work in a charity and run their social media accounts, pictured to the right is me and a coworker (at the time) posing for a valentines day post to help share the love! ðŸ˜Š

          <h3>Bomberman</h3>
          <p>Bomberman was my work in a group project where me and 5 others created a party game inspired by the likes of Mario Party.
            My task was to create a game that functioned like popular game - Bomberman. This involved me creating all of the movements, camera angles
            as well as the logic behind the game which dictated where the bombs could or could not spawn.
            You can see on this video that there is a basic User Interface(UI) that helps you understand the state of the game as it is being played.
            Players are able to kill and be killed as a result of the explosions that could cascade between bombs.
